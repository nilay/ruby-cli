# RUBY CLI Application 

This simple CLI application prints first 20 even numbered todos when executed. The todos are being fetched from API.

In order to run this CLI app, you need to have ruby interpreter executable under `/usr/bin/env`.

Checkout CLI project, `cd` into project directory and then make the `todos.rb` file executable

`$ chmod +x my_cli_app.rb`

Now you can run CLI application:
$ ./todos.rb

If you do not have ruby interpreter set under `/usr/bin/env` directory, you can directly run as:
$ ruby todos.rb
